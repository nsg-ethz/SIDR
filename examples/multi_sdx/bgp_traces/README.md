# Multi-SDX Deployment

Packet capture of the multi SDX setup with different BGP advertisement settings and different order of SDX start up.

## Policy Based Best Path

* ***policy1_sdx1.pcapng*** and ***policy1_sdx2.pcapng*** - packet capture of the route server at sdx1 and sdx2. sdx1 was started before sdx2.
* ***policy2_sdx1.pcapng*** and ***policy2_sdx2.pcapng*** - packet capture of the route server at sdx1 and sdx2. sdx2 was started before sdx1.

## Blocking Policy Based Best Path

* ***blocking1_sdx1.pcapng*** and ***blocking1_sdx2.pcapng*** - packet capture of the route server at sdx1 and sdx2. sdx1 was started before sdx2.
* ***blocking2_sdx1.pcapng*** and ***blocking2_sdx2.pcapng*** - packet capture of the route server at sdx1 and sdx2. sdx2 was started before sdx1.
